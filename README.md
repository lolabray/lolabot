## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
LolaBot was developed by a camgirl who was looking for a way to control her lovense toys in her discord server.
<br>LolaBot is controlled by slash commands (example: /high) that activate the toys via the discord bot.

## üé• Demo <a name = "demo"></a>

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
### Installing <a name = "installing"></a>

1) Install node.js at https://nodejs.org/en/. (Minimum v16.6 but, I recommend downloading the latest version of v16)

2) Next, You will need to download the source code from GitHub. This can be done either via the Green **Code** Button and clicking Download ZIP, and Extracting the contents where you'd like.

3) Then open a powershell window (Shift+LeftClick) in the LolaBot main folder.
<br>

![working](https://imgur.com/pDFbcrt.gif)<br>

3) In that powershell window, download all the required packages for this to work. This includes some stuff for Discord and basic Web requests:<br>

```
npm install
```
![working](https://i.imgur.com/dPSOFtl.gif)<br>

## üöÄ Deploying your own bot <a name = "deployment"></a>
1) Log onto the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application.<br>
![working](https://imgur.com/JS4TdZK.png)<br>

2) Set your photo, name your bot, add a description.<br>
3) Select "Bot" on the side panel, under settings.<br>
  ![working](https://imgur.com/Etzf6RF.png)<br>
  Click to find your token, copy this and add it to the file config.json that you downloaded.<br>
  ![working](https://imgur.com/n0drNJW.png)<br>
  Replace "YOUR-DISCORD-TOKEN" in `config.json`, with the token you copied. (KEEP THIS SAFE)<br>
  ![working](https://imgur.com/br2RKT8.png)<br>

4) Next find your guild ID, which will also need to be replaced in `config.json` by:<br>
  Turning on developer mode on your Discord client, under Settings/Advanced.<br>
  ![working](https://imgur.com/vyvqNW3.png)<br>
  Once developer mode is on, right click on the server/channel your bot is joining and copy ID (bottom of menu). This is your guild ID.<br>
  ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/TwByqjP.png)

5) Go to OAuth2 on the Discord Developer Portal, located on the side panel under settings, and select the URL Generator.<br>
  ![working](https://i.imgur.com/zTTsN1S.png)<br>
  From here, click the `bot` & `applications.commands` scopes and generate a url. You can also set permissions below, or leave it blank.<br>
  ![working](https://i.imgur.com/3BZoziQ.png)<br>
  Copy this url into your web browser and add the bot to a server you manage<br>
  ![working](https://imgur.com/GA84dnX.png)<br>

6) Last, find your client ID by left clicking on the bot (once it's added in the previous step), going to 'copy ID' and replace in `config.json`.

### üîß Configuring the Bot
As all great things should, you should be able to Customise your Toys to have fun. üòâ In the bot we have Customisations for each of the Toy's Power, and the Default Power it will select when no Power is provided.

`defaultPower` requires you a Number from 1-20 (weakest - strongest)<br />
`toy_power` is a List where you can provide the name which is displayed in Discord and Value is the Power which will be applied to the Bot. If you want to add a new item, copy a row and change the name & value to whatever you please.<br />
REMEMBER to keep the comma at the end UNLESS it is the last row and keep them contained inside of the square brackets \[ \].
```json
	"defaultPower": 20,
	"toy_power": [
		{ "name": "low",    "value": 1 },
		{ "name": "medium", "value": 10 },
		{ "name": "high",   "value": 20 }
	]
```


### Deploy the Bot
Deploying the bot will create the commands based upon which toys which are available within the app (even if they're not online). So if you have added more toys to your collection, please re-run this command and it will add them too.

1) Go to the main file folder that you downloaded from GitHub and reopen your Powershell window (Shift+LeftClick) if you have closed it.

  This time, copy and paste the following in powershell:
  ```
  npm run deploy
  ```
  This should reply with information about your toys and finally end off on: **Successfully registered slash commands.**<br />
  If this returns **No information found in Lovense Config**, Make sure that your Phone/Desktop App is online and re-try running the deploy script.
  <br /><br/>
  If this keeps on failing, please manually run https://api.lovense.com/api/lan/getToys in your browser and place the `domain` and `httpsPort` (Not to be confused with `httpPort`) inside of the `config.json` in the `config_domain` and `config_port` fields, and again retry.<br />
  This directly calls the local API for the information on the toys you have, but doesn't effect the usage of the bot. üò∏

2) Next, start the bot with the following command:
  ```
  npm run main
  ```

  If done correctly, the bot should say information about your current toys, and finally say **LolaBot 3.0 - Ready to Play!** when the bot is online and ready.<br />
  Do not close the powershell window while the bot is operating as this will stop it.<br>
  Each time you want to run the bot, you must repeat Step 2 and leave the powershell window open.<br>
